<!-- -->

Devel Freezer is a GitHub Action that can automatically notify contributors of your open-source project about the state of development. When the project is in development freeze or when the development freeze has ended.

## How does it work

TBA ...

## Features

* Ability to comment on Pull Requests predefined messages based on the latest tags
* Ability to find and update comments from Devel Freezer GitHub Action
* [Policy based](#policy) configuration using YAML syntax
* Support for regular expressions for freezing tags definitions
* And more ...

## Usage

To setup Development freeze, we need three files:

* Workflow that captures Pull Request metadata (number) and uploads this data as artifact
* Workflow that runs on `workflow-run` trigger, downloads artifact and runs `devel_freezer` GitHub Action
* `development-freeze` configuration

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
> **Note**: Setup is complicated due to GitHub [permissions on `GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token). When used in workflow executed from fork it has `read-only` permissions. By using `workflow-run` trigger we are able to [safely overcome this limitation](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/) and it allow us to comment on Pull Requests.

```yml
name: Gather Pull Request Metadata

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_DIR: pull_request
  PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE: metadata

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  gather-metadata:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Repository checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Store PR number in file
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_DIR }}
          echo ${{ github.event.number }} > ./${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_DIR }}/${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}

      - name: Upload Pull Request Metadata artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: ${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}
          path: ${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_DIR }}
          retention-days: 1
```

```yml
name: Development Freeze

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [ Gather Pull Request Metadata ]
    types:
      - completed

env:
  PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_DIR: pull_request
  PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE: metadata

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  freezer:
    if: >
      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request' &&
      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - name: Download Pull Request Metadata artifact
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            var artifacts = await github.rest.actions.listWorkflowRunArtifacts({
               owner: context.repo.owner,
               repo: context.repo.repo,
               run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }},
            });
            var matchArtifact = artifacts.data.artifacts.filter((artifact) => {
              return artifact.name == "${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}"
            })[0];
            var download = await github.rest.actions.downloadArtifact({
               owner: context.repo.owner,
               repo: context.repo.repo,
               artifact_id: matchArtifact.id,
               archive_format: 'zip',
            });
            const fs = require('fs');
            fs.writeFileSync('${{ github.workspace }}/${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}.zip', Buffer.from(download.data));
      - run: unzip ${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}.zip

      - name: 'Get Pull Request number'
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const pr_number = Number(fs.readFileSync('./${{ env.PULL_REQUEST_METADATA_FILE }}'));
            core.exportVariable('pr_number', pr_number);
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Repository checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Development Freezer
        uses: redhat-plumbers-in-action/devel-freezer@v1
        with:
          pr-number: ${{ env.pr_number }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> **Note**: `fetch-depth: 0` is required in order to have access to full history including tags.

```yml
policy:
  - tags: ['alpha', 'beta']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        ü•∂ We are currently in ...
        üôè Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        üòé We are no longer in ...

  # Suport for regular expressions
  - tags: ['^\S*-rc\d$']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        We are currently in a development freeze phase.
        Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        We had successfully released a new major release.
        We are no longer in a development freeze phase.
```

### Real-life examples

Feel free to try `devel-freezer` using template repository - [`@redhat-plumbers-in-action/development-freeze-automation`](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/development-freeze-automation)

## Configuration options

Action currently accepts the following options:

```yml
# ...

- uses: redhat-plumbers-in-action/devel-freezer@v1
  with:
    pr-number:    <number>
    config-path:  <path to config file>
    token:        <GitHub token or PAT>

# ...
```

### pr-number

Pull Request number.

* default value: `${{ github.event.number }}`
* requirements: `required`

### config-path

Path to configuration file. Configuration file format is described in: [Policy section](#policy).

* default value: `.github/development-freeze.yml`
* requirements: `optional`

### token

GitHub token or PAT is used for creating comments on Pull Request.

```yml
# required permission
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `required`
* recomended value: `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Policy

It's required to define a freezing policy for Action to behave correctly. The policy can be defined using `.github/development-freeze.yml` configuration file. The structure needs to be as follows:

```yml
policy:
  - tags: ['alpha', 'beta']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        ü•∂ We are currently in ...
        üôè Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        üòé We are no longer in ...

  # Suport for regular expressions
  - tags: ['^\S*-rc\d$']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        We are currently in a development freeze phase.
        Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        We had successfully released a new major release.
        We are no longer in a development freeze phase.
  # tags: ...
```

### `tags` keyword

Array of tag names and/or regular expressions describing freezing tag scheme (e.g. `^\S*-rc\d$` for tags like `v251-rc1`, `v252-rc2`, etc.). Multiple freezing schemes are supported.

* requirements: `required`

### `feedback.frozen-state` keyword

The message that is going to be displayed in form of a comment when development freeze conditions are met. Support for a multi-line string using `|` YAML syntax.

* requirements: `required`

### `feedback.unfreeze-state` keyword

The message that is going to replace the development freeze message when development freeze conditions are no longer met. Support for a multi-line string using `|` YAML syntax.

* requirements: `required`
