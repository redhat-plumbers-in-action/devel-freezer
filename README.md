Devel Freezer is a GitHub Action that can automatically notify contributors of your open-source project about the state of development. When the project is in development freeze or when the development freeze has ended.

## How does it work

TBA ...

## Features

* Ability to comment on Pull Requests predefined messages based on the latest tags
* Ability to find and update comments from Devel Freezer GitHub Action
* [Policy based](#policy) configuration using YAML syntax
* Support for regular expressions for freezing tags definitions
* And more ...

## Usage

```yml
name: Development Freezer
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ opened, reopened, synchronize ]
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  freezer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Development Freezer
        uses: redhat-plumbers-in-action/devel-freezer@latest
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> **Note**: `fetch-depth: 0` is required in order to have access to full history including tags.

```yml
policy:
  - tags: ['alpha', 'beta']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        ü•∂ We are currently in ...
        üôè Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        üòé We are no longer in ...

  # Suport for regular expressions
  - tags: ['^\S*-rc\d$']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        We are currently in a development freeze phase.
        Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        We had successfully released a new major release.
        We are no longer in a development freeze phase.
```

### Real-life examples

Feel free to try `devel-freezer` using template repository - [`@redhat-plumbers-in-action/development-freeze-automation`](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/development-freeze-automation)

## Configuration options

Action currently accepts the following options:

```yml
# ...

- uses: redhat-plumbers-in-action/devel-freezer@latest
  with:
    token: <GitHub token>

# ...
```

### token

Token used to create comments. Minimal required permissions are `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `required`
* recomended value: `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Policy

It's required to define a freezing policy for Action to behave correctly. The policy can be defined using `.github/development-freeze.yml` configuration file. The structure needs to be as follows:

```yml
policy:
  - tags: ['alpha', 'beta']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        ü•∂ We are currently in ...
        üôè Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        üòé We are no longer in ...

  # Suport for regular expressions
  - tags: ['^\S*-rc\d$']
    feedback:
      frozen-state: |
        We are currently in a development freeze phase.
        Please ...
      unfreeze-state: |
        We had successfully released a new major release.
        We are no longer in a development freeze phase.
  # tags: ...
```

### `tags` keyword

Array of tag names and/or regular expressions describing freezing tag scheme (e.g. `^\S*-rc\d$` for tags like `v251-rc1`, `v252-rc2`, etc.). Multiple freezing schemes are supported.

* requirements: `required`

### `feedback.frozen-state` keyword

The message that is going to be displayed in form of a comment when development freeze conditions are met. Support for a multi-line string using `|` YAML syntax.

* requirements: `required`

### `feedback.unfreeze-state` keyword

The message that is going to replace the development freeze message when development freeze conditions are no longer met. Support for a multi-line string using `|` YAML syntax.

* requirements: `required`
